      "\"May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?\" said \n",
      "Dudley, offering his fat arm to an invisible woman. \n",

      "Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you.\"' \n",
      " \n",
      "This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. Aunt Petunia \n",
      "burst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under the \n",
      "table so they wouldn't see him laughing. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"And you, boy?\" \n",
      " \n",

      "he said. \n",
      " \n",

      "When dinner's over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for \n",
      "coffee, Petunia, and I'll bring the subject around to drills. With any \n",
      "luck, I'll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten. \n",
      "be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time to \n",
      "morrow. \n",
      "Harry couldn't feel too excited about this. He didn't think the \n",

      "Privet Drive. \n",
      "\"Right - I'm off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for \n",
      "Dudley and me. And you,\" he snarled at Harry. \"You stay out of \n",
      "your aunt's way while she's cleaning.\" \n",
      "Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day. \n",
      "He crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang \n",
      "under his breath: \n",
      "\"Happy birthday to me ... happy birthday to me. . . \n",
      "No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening \n",
      "pretending not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He had \n",
      "never felt so lonely. More than anything else at Hogwarts, more \n",
      "even than playing Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron \n",
      "Weasley and Hermione Granger. They, however, didn't seem to be \n",
      "missing him at all. Neither of them had written to him all summer, \n",
      "even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and \n",
      "stay. \n",
      "Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking \n",
      "Hedwig's cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione \n",
      "with a letter, but it wasn't worth the risk. Underage wizards weren't \n",
      "allowed to use magic outside of school. Harry hadn't told the \n",
      " \n",
      "Dursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them \n",
      "all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in the \n",
      "cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick. For the first \n",
      "couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words \n",
      "under his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast \n",
      "as his fat legs would carry him. But the long silence from Ron and \n",
      "Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that \n",
      "even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal - and now Ron and Hermione \n",
      "had forgotten his birthday. \n",
      " \n",
      "What wouldn't he give now for a message from Hogwarts? From any \n",
      "witch or wizard? He'd almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy, \n",
      "Draco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn't all been a dream .... \n",
      " \n",
      "Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of \n",
      "last term, Harry had come face-to-face with none other than Lord \n",
      "Voldemort himself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his former self, but \n",
      "he was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to regain power. \n",
      "Harry had slipped through Voldemort's clutches for a second time, but \n",
      "it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept \n",
      "waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where \n",
      "Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his wide, mad eyes \n",
      " \n",
      "Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had been \n",
      "staring absent-mindedly into the hedge - and the hedge was staring back. \n",
      "Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves. \n",
      " \n",
      "Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the \n",
      "lawn. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"I know what day it is,\" sang Dudley, waddling toward him. \n",
      " \n",
      "The huge eyes blinked and vanished. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"What?\" said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot where they had \n",
      "been. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"I know what day it is,\" Dudley repeated, coming right up to him. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Well done,\" said Harry. \"So you've finally learned the days of the \n",
      "week.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Today's your birthday,\" sneered Dudley. \"How come you haven't got \n",

      " \n",
      "\"Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school,\" said \n",
      "Harry coolly. \n",
      " \n",

      "bottom. \n",
      " \n",

      " \n",

      "\" I , m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on \n",
      "fire,\" said Harry. \n",
      " \n",

      " \n",
      "\"You c-can't - Dad told you you're not to do m-magic - he said he'll \n",
      "chuck you out of the house - and you haven't got anywhere else to go - \n",
      "you haven't got any friends to take you -\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Jiggery pokery!\" said Harry in a fierce voice. \"Hocus pocus squiggly \n",
      "wiggly -\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"MUUUUUUM!\" howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashed \n",
      "back toward the house. \"MUUUUM! He's doing you know what!\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor \n",
      " \n",
      "the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn't really \n",
      "done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his \n",
      "head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, with \n",
      "the promise he wouldn't eat again until he'd finished. \n",
      " \n",
      "While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harry \n",
      "cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the \n",
      "flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden \n",
      "bench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of his neck. Harry \n",
      "knew he shouldn't have risen to Dudley's bait, but Dudley had said \n",
      "the very thing Harry had been thinking himself... maybe he didn't have \n",
      "any friends at Hogwarts .... \n",
      " \n",
      "Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he thought savagely as he \n",

      "down his face. \n",
      " \n",
      "It was half past seven ,in the evening when at last, exhausted, he \n",

      " \n",
      "\"Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top of \n",
      "the fridge stood tonight's pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream \n",
      "and sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!\" snapped Aunt Petunia, \n",
      "pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen \n",
      "table. She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail dress. \n",
      " \n",
      "Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The \n",

      "As he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a \n",
      "glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jack \n",

      "bell rang and Uncle Vernon's furious face appeared at the foot of \n",
      "the stairs. \n",
      "\"Remember, boy - one sound -\" \n",
      "Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside, closed \n",

      "creature on the bed had large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the \n",
      "size of tennis balls. Harry knew instantly that this was what had been \n",
      "watching him out of the garden hedge that morning. \n",
      " \n",
      "As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley's voice from the hall. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?\" \n",
      " \n",
      "The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its \n",
      "long, thin nose touched the carpet. Harry noticed that it was wearing \n",
      "what looked like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Er - hello,\" said Harry nervously. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Harry Potter!\" said the creature in a high-pitched voice Harry was \n",
      "sure would carry down the stairs. \"So long has Dobby wanted to meet \n",
      "you, sir ... Such an honor it is . . . .\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Th-thank you,\" said Harry, edging along the wall and sinking into his \n",
      "desk chair, next to Hedwig, who was asleep in her large cage. He \n",
      "wanted to ask, \"What are you?\" but thought it would sound too rude, \n",
      "so instead he said, \"Who are you?\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,\" said the creature. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Oh - really?\" said Harry. \"Er - I don't want to be rude or anything, \n",

      "bedroom.\" \n",
      " \n",

      "Harry, trying to say \"Shh!\" and look comforting at the same time, \n",
      "ushered Dobby back onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing, looking \n",
      "like a large and very ugly doll. At last he managed to control himself, \n",
      "and sat with his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression of watery \n",
      "adoration. \n",

      "\"Don't - what are you doing?\" Harry hissed, springing up and pulling \n",

      " \n",
      "\"Oh, no, sir, no ... Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously \n",

      " \n",
      "Harry had heard these rumors about Malfoy's family before, and they \n",
      "didn't surprise him at all. Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "like a kind, thoughtful, and sensitive boy. \n",

      "\"I don't know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf  \n",

      " \n",
      "\"Yeah, Mum's always wishing we had a house-elf to do the ironing,\" \n",

      ". . .\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Harry was silent. Judging by the fact that Draco Malfoy usually had \n",
      "the best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he \n",
      " \n",
      "could just see Malfoy strutting around a large manor house. Sending \n",
      "the family servant to stop Harry from going back to Hogwarts also \n",
      "sounded exactly like the sort of thing Malfoy would do. Had Harry \n",
      "been stupid to take Dobby seriously? \n",
      " \n",
      "\"I'm glad we came to get you, anyway,\" said Ron. \"I was getting \n",
      "really worried when you didn't answer any of my letters. I thought it \n",

      " \n",
      "\"Who's Errol?\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Our owl. He's ancient. It wouldn't be the first time he'd collapsed \n",

      "shop. This Muggle woman bought it, took it home, and tried to serve \n",

      "\"What happened?\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"The teapot went berserk and squirted boiling tea all over the place \n",

      " \n",
      "Fred laughed. \"Yeah, Dad's crazy about everything to do with \n",

      "Lower and lower went the flying car. The edge of a brilliant red sun \n",
      "was now gleaming through the trees. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Touchdown!\" said Fred as, with a slight bump, they hit the ground. \n",
      "They had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small yard, and \n",
      "Harry looked out for the first time at Ron's house. \n",
      " \n",
      "It looked as though it had once been a large stone pigpen, but extra \n",
      "rooms had been added here and there until it was several stories high \n",
      "and so crooked it looked as though it were held up by magic (which, \n",
      "Harry reminded himself, it probably was). Four or five chimneys were \n",
      "perched on top of the red roof. A lopsided sign stuck in the ground \n",
      "near the entrance read, THE BuRRow. Around the front door lay a jumble \n",
      "of rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron. Several fat brown chickens \n",

      "\"Now, we'll go upstairs really quietly,\" said Fred, \"and wait for Mum to \n",

      "Harry and no one need ever know we flew the car.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Right,\" said Ron. \"Come on, Harry, I sleep at the - at the top \n",

      "Mrs. Weasley was marching across the yard, scattering chickens, and \n",
      "for a short, plump, kind-faced woman, it was remarkable how much \n",

      " \n",
      "All three of Mrs. Weasley's sons were taller than she was, but they \n",

      " \n",
      "\"YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF PERCY'S \n",

      " \n",

      "glance at Ron, who nodded encouragingly, followed her. \n",
      " \n",
      "The kitchen was small and rather cramped. There was a \n",
      " \n",
      "scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle, and Harry sat down \n",
      "on the edge of his seat, looking around. He had never been in a wizard \n",
      "house before. \n",
      " \n",
      "The clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers \n",
      "at all. Written around the edge were things like Time to make tea, Time \n",
      "to feed the chickens, and You're late. Books were stacked three deep on \n",
      "the mantelpiece, books with titles like Charm Your Own Cheese, \n",
      "Enchantment in Baking, and One Minute Feasts - It's Magic! And unless \n",
      "Harry's ears were deceiving him, the old radio next to the sink had just \n",

      "singing sorceress, Celestina Warbeck.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Mrs. Weasley was clattering around, cooking breakfast a little \n",
      "haphazardly, throwing dirty looks at her sons as she threw sausages \n",
      "into the frying pan. Every now and then she muttered things like \"don't \n",
      "know what you were thinking of,\" and \"never would have believed it.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"I don't blame you, dear,\" she assured Harry, tipping eight or nine \n",
      "sausages onto his plate. \"Arthur and I have been worried about you, \n",
      "too. Just last night we were saying we'd come and get you ourselves if \n",
      "you hadn't written back to Ron by Friday. But really,\" (she was now \n",
      "adding three fried eggs to his plate) \"flying an illegal car halfway \n",
      "across the country - anyone could have seen you -\" \n",
      " \n",
      "She flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink, which began to \n",

      " \n",
      "\"They were starving him, Mum!\" said George. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"And you!\" said Mrs. Weasley, but it was with a slightly softened \n",
      "expression that she started cutting Harry bread and buttering it for \n",
      "him. \n",
      " \n",
      "At that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small, \n",
      "redheaded figure in a long nightdress, who appeared in the kitchen, \n",
      "gave a small squeal, and ran out again. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Ginny,\" said Ron in an undertone to Harry. \"My sister. She's been \n",

      " \n",
      "\"Yeah, she'll be wanting your autograph, Harry,\" Fred said with a grin, \n",
      "but he caught his mother's eye and bent his face over his plate without \n",
      "another word. Nothing more was said until all four plates were clean, \n",
      "which took a surprisingly short time. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Blimey, I'm tired,\" yawned Fred, setting down his knife and fork at last. \n",
      "\"I think I'll go to bed and -\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"You will not,\" snapped Mrs. Weasley. \"It's your own fault you've \n",
      "been up all night. You're going to de-gnome the garden for me; they're \n",

      " \n",
      "\"Oh, Mum -\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"And you two,\" she said, glaring at Ron and Fred. \"You can go up to \n",

      "wretched car -\" \n",
      " \n",
      "But Harry, who felt wide awake, said quickly, \"I'll help Ron. I've \n",
      "never seen a de-gnoming -\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"That's very sweet of you, dear, but it's dull work,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \n",
      "\"Now, let's see what Lockhart's got to say on the subject -\" \n",
      " \n",
      "And she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece. \n",
      "George groaned. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden -\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Harry looked at the cover of Mrs. Weasley's book. Written across it \n",
      "in fancy gold letters were the words Gilderoy Lockhart's Guide to \n",
      "Household Pests. There was a big photograph on the front of a very good- \n",
      "IOI)king wizard with wavy blond hair and bright blue eyes. As always \n",
      "in the wizarding world, the photograph was moving; the wizard, who \n",
      "Harry supposed was Gilderoy Lockhart, kept winking cheekily up at \n",
      "them all. Mrs. Weasley beamed down at him. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Oh, he is marvelous,\" she said. \"He knows his household pests, all \n",
      "right, it's a wonderful book . . . .\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Mum fancies him,\" said Fred, in a very audible whisper. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Don't be so ridiculous, Fred,\" said Mrs. Weasley, her cheeks rather \n",
      "pink. \"All right, if you think you know better than Lockhart, you can go \n",
      "and get on with it, and woe betide you if there's a single gnome in that \n",
      "garden when I come out to inspect it.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Yawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched outside with Harry \n",
      "behind them. The garden was large, and in Harry's eyes, exactlY \n",
      "what a garden should be. The Dursleys wouldn't have liked it - there \n",
      "were plenty of weeds, and the grass needed cutting but there were \n",
      "gnarled trees all around the walls, plants Harry had never seen spilling \n",
      "from every flower bed, and a big green pond full of frogs. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,\" Harry told Ron \n",
      " \n",
      "they crossed the lawn. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Yeah, I've seen those things they think are gnomes,\" said Ron, bent \n",
      "double with his head in a peony bush, \"like fat little Santa Clauses with \n",
      "fishing rods . . . .\" \n",
      " \n",
      "There was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered, and \n",
      "Ron straightened up. \"This is a gnome,\" he said grimly. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Gerroff me! Gerroff me!\" squealed the gnome. \n",
      " \n",
      "It was certainly nothing like Santa Claus. It was small and leathery \n",
      "looking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like a potato. Ron held \n",
      "it at arm's length as it kicked out at him with its horny little feet; he \n",
      "grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"This is what you have to do,\" he said. He raised the gnome above his \n",
      "head (\"Gerroff me!\") and started to swing it in great circles like a \n",
      "lasso. Seeing the shocked look on Harry's face, Ron added, \"It doesn't \n",
      "hurt them - you've just got to make them really dizzy so they can't find \n",
      "their way back to the gnomeholes.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "He let go of the gnome's ankles: It flew twenty feet into the air and \n",
      "landed with a thud in the field over the hedge. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Pitiful,\" said Fred. \"I bet I can get mine beyond that stump.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes. He decided \n",
      "just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge, but the gnome, \n",
      "sensing weakness, sank its razor-sharp teeth into Harry's finger and he \n",
      "had a hard job shaking it off - until \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Wow, Harry - that must've been fifty feet ...... \n",
      " \n",
      "The air was soon thick with flying gnomes. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"See, they're not too bright,\" said George, seizing five or six gnomes at \n",
      "once. \"The moment they know the de-gnoming's going on they storm \n",
      "up to have a look. You'd think they'd have learned by now just to stay \n",
      "put.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Soon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a \n",
      "straggling line, their little shoulders hunched. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"They'll be back,\" said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into \n",

      "Mr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and \n",
      "his eyes closed. He was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair he \n",
      "had was as red as any of his children's. He was wearing long green \n",
      "robes, which were dusty and travel-worn. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"What a night,\" he mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all sat \n",

      " \n",
      "through the house. On the third landing, a door stood ajar. Harry just \n",

      "Harry stepped in, his head almost touching the sloping ceiling, and \n",
      "blinked. It was like walking into a furnace: Nearly everything in Ron's \n",
      "room seemed to be a violent shade of orange: the bedspread, the \n",
      "walls, even the ceiling. Then Harry realized that Ron had covered \n",
      "nearly every inch of the shabby wallpaper with posters of the same \n",
      "seven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes, carrying \n",

      "and looked out of the tiny window. In the field far below he could see \n",
      "a gang of gnomes sneaking one by one back through the Weasleys' \n",

      "small explosions from Fred and George's bedroom were considered \n",
      "perfectly normal. What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron's, \n",

      " \n",
      "Harry, Ron, Fred, and George were planning to go up the hill to a \n",
      "small paddock the Weasleys owned. It was surrounded by trees that \n",
      "blocked it from view of the village below, meaning that they could \n",
      "practice Quidditch there, as long as they didn't fly too high. \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "They couldn't use real Quidditch balls, which would have been hard to \n",
      "explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village; instead \n",
      "they threw apples for one another to catch. They took turns riding \n",
      "Harry's Nimbus Two Thousand, which was easily the best broom; \n",
      "Ron's old Shooting Star was often outstripped by passing butterflies. \n",
      " \n",
      "Five minutes later they were marching up the hill, broomsticks over \n",
      "their shoulders. They had asked Percy if he wanted to join them, but \n",
      "he had said he was busy. Harry had only seen Percy at mealtimes so \n",
      "far; he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Wish I knew what he was up to,\" said Fred, frowning. \"He's not \n",
      "himself. His exam results came the day before you did; twelve \n",

      " \n",
      "\"Ordinary Wizarding Levels,\" George explained, seeing Harry's \n",

      "another Head Boy in the family. I don't think I could stand the shame.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Bill was the oldest Weasley brother. He and the next brother, Charlie, \n",
      "had already left Hogwarts. Harry had never met either of them, but \n",
      "knew that Charlie was in Romania studying dragons and Bill in Egypt \n",

      " \n",
      "\"Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff this \n",

      "Ginny needs robes and a wand and everything ...... \n",
      " \n",
      "Harry said nothing. He felt a bit awkward. Stored in an underground \n",
      "vault at Gringotts in London was a small fortune that his parents had \n",
      "left him. Of course, it was only in the wizarding world that he had \n",
      "money; you couldn't use Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "in Muggle shops. He had never mentioned his Gringotts bank account \n",
      "to the Dursleys; he didn't think their horror of anything connected with \n",
      "magic would stretch to a large pile of gold. \n",
      " \n",
      "Mrs. Weasley woke them all early the following Wednesday. After a \n",
      "quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each, they pulled on their coats \n",

      "Harry, I forgot.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Never?\" said Mr. Weasley. \"But how did you get to Diagon Alley to \n",
      "buy your school things last year?\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"I went on the Underground -\" \n",
      " \n",

      "exactly -\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Not now, Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Floo powder's a lot quicker, \n",
      "dear, but goodness me, if you've never used it before -\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"He'll be all right, Mum,\" said Fred. \"Harry, watch us first.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "He took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot, stepped up \n",
      "to the fire, and threw the powder into the flames. \n",
      " \n",
      "With a roar, the fire turned emerald green and rose higher than Fred, \n",
      "who stepped right into it, shouted, \"Diagon Alley!\" and vanished. \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "\"You must speak clearly, dear,\" Mrs. Weasley told Harry as George \n",
      "dipped his hand into the flowerpot. \"And be sure to get out at the right \n",
      "grate ...... \n",

      "\"The right what?\" said Harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped \n",
      "George out of sight, too. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Well, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from, you know, \n",
      "but as long as you've spoken clearly -\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"He'll be fine, Molly, don't fuss,\" said Mr. Weasley, helping himself to \n",
      "Floo powder, too. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"But, dear, if he got lost, how would we ever explain to his aunt and \n",
      "uncle?\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"They wouldn't mind,\" Harry reassured her. \"Dudley would think it \n",
      "was a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney, don't worry about that -\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Well ... all right ... you go after Arthur,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"Now, \n",
      "when you get into the fire, say where you're going \n",
      " \n",
      "\"And keep your elbows tucked in,\" Ron advised. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"And your eyes shut,\" said Mrs. Weasley. \"The soot -\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Don't fidget,\" said Ron. \"Or you might well fall out of the wrong \n",

      "\"But don't panic and get out too early; wait until you see Fred and \n",
      "George.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Trying hard to bear all this in mind, Harry took a pinch of Floo powder \n",
      "and walked to the edge of the fire. He took a deep breath, scattered \n",
      "the powder into the flames, and stepped forward; the fire felt like a \n",
      "warm breeze; he opened his mouth and immediately swallowed a lot \n",
      "of hot ash. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"D-Dia-gon Alley,\" he coughed. \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "It felt as though he was being sucked down a giant drain. He seemed \n",

      "tried to keep his eyes open but the whirl of green flames made him \n",
      "feel sick - something hard knocked his elbow and he tucked it in \n",
      "tightly, still spinning and spinning - now it felt as though cold hands \n",
      "were slapping his face - squinting through his glasses he saw a blurred \n",
      "stream of fireplaces and snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond - his \n",
      "bacon sandwiches were churning inside him - he closed his eyes again \n",
      "wishing it would stop, and then \n",
      " \n",
      "He fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his glasses \n",
      "snap. \n",
      " \n",
      "Dizzy and bruised, covered in soot, he got gingerly to his feet, holding \n",
      "his broken glasses up to his eyes. He was -,cite alone, but where he \n",
      "was, he had no idea. All he could tell was that he was standing in the \n",
      "stone fireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit wizard's shop - but \n",
      "nothing in here was ever likely to be on a Hogwarts school list. \n",
      " \n",
      "A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstained \n",
      "pack of cards, and a staring glass eye. Evil-looking masks stared down \n",
      "from the walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter, \n",
      "and rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling. Even worse, the \n",
      "dark, narrow street Harry could see through the dusty shop window \n",
      "was definitely not Diagon Alley. \n",
      " \n",
      "The sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still stinging where it \n",

      "door, but before he'd got halfway toward it, two people appeared on \n",
      "the other side of the glass - and one of them was the \n",

      " \n",
      " \n",
      "very last person Harry wanted to meet when he was lost, covered in \n",

      "the shop. \n",
      " \n",
      "The man who followed could only be Draco's father. He had the same \n",
      "pale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes. Mr. Malfoy crossed \n",

      " \n",
      "\"Check that no one's watching,\" said Ron, starting the ignition with \n",
      "another tap of his wand. Harry stuck his head out of the window: \n",
      "Traffic was rumbling along the main road ahead, but their street was \n",
      "empty. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Okay,\" he said. \n",

      " \n",
      "\"Let's go,\" said Ron's voice from his right. \n",

      " \n",
      "Then there was a popping noise and the car, Harry, and Ron \n",

      " \n",
      "\"Uh-oh,\" said Ron, jabbing at the Invisibility Booster. \"It's faulty -\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Both of them pummeled it. The car vanished. Then it flickered back \n",
      "again. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Hold on!\" Ron yelled, and he slammed his foot on the acceler \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "ator; they shot straight into the low, woolly clouds and everything \n",
      "turned dull and foggy. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Now what?\" said Harry, blinking at the solid mass of cloud pressing \n",
      "in on them from all sides. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"We need to see the train to know what direction to go in,\" said Ron. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Dip back down again - quickly -\" \n",
      " \n",
      "They dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in their \n",
      "seats, squinting at the ground. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"I can see it!\" Harry yelled. \"Right ahead - there!\" \n",

      "\"Okay, we'll just have to check on it every half hour or so - hold on \n",

      "into a blaze of sunlight. \n",
      " \n",
      "It was a different world. The wheels of the car skimmed the sea of \n",
      "fluffy cloud, the sky a bright, endless blue under the blinding white sun. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"All we've got to worry about now are airplanes,\" said Ron. \n",
      " \n",

      "couldn't stop. \n",
      " \n",
      "It was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream. This, \n",
      "thought Harry, was surely the only way to travel - past swirls and \n",
      "turrets of snowy cloud, in a car full of hot, bright sunlight, with a fat \n",
      "pack of toffees in the glove compartment, and the prospect of seeing \n",
      "Fred's and George's jealous faces when they \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "landed smoothly and spectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front of \n",
      "Hogwarts castle. \n",
      " \n",
      "They made regular checks on the train as they flew farther and \n",
      "farther north, each dip beneath the clouds showing them a different \n",
      "view. London was soon far behind them, replaced by neat green \n",
      "fields that gave way in turn to wide, purplish moors, a great city alive \n",
      "with cars like multicolored ants, villages with tiny toy churches. \n",
      " \n",
      "Several uneventful hours later, however, Harry had to admit that \n",
      "some of the fun was wearing off. The toffees had made them \n",
      "extremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink. He and Ron had \n",
      "pulled off their sweaters, but Harry's T-shirt was sticking to the back \n",
      "of his seat and his glasses kept sliding down to the end of his sweaty \n",
      "nose. He had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and \n",
      "was thinking longingly of the train miles below, where you could buy \n",
      "ice-cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a plump witch. Why \n",
      "hadn't they been able to get onto platform nine and three-quarters? \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Can't be much further, can it?\" croaked Ron, hours later still, as the \n",
      "sun started to sink into their floor of cloud, staining it a deep pink. \n",
      "\"Ready for another check on the train?\" \n",
      " \n",
      "It was still right below them, winding its way past a snowcapped \n",
      "mountain. It was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds. \n",
      " \n",
      "Ron put his foot on the accelerator and drove them upward again, \n",
      "but as he did so, the engine began to whine. \n",
      " \n",
      "Harry and Ron exchanged nervous glances. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"It's probably just tired,\" said Ron. \"It's never been this far before \n",
      "... \n",
      " \n",
      "And they both pretended not to notice the whining growing \n",
      "louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker. Stars were \n",
      "blossoming in the blackness. Harry pulled his sweater back on, try \n",
      "ing to ignore the way the windshield wipers were now waving fee \n",
      "bly, as though in protest. \n",
      "\"Not far,\" said Ron, more to the car than to Harry, \"not far \n",
      "now,\" and he patted the dashboard nervously. \n",
      "When they flew back beneath the clouds a little while later, they \n",
      "had to squint through the darkness for a landmark they knew. \n",
      "\"There!\" Harry shouted, making Ron and Hedwig jump. \n",
      "\"Straight ahead!\" \n",
      "Silhouetted on the dark horizon, high on the cliff over the lake, \n",
      "stood the many turrets and towers of Hogwarts castle. \n",
      "But the car had begun to shudder and was losing speed. \n",
      "\"Come on,\" Ron said cajolingly, giving the steering wheel a lit \n",
      "tle shake, \"nearly there, come on -\" \n",
      "The engine groaned. Narrow jets of steam were issuing from un \n",
      "der the hood. Harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat \n",
      "very hard as they flew toward the lake. \n",
      "The car gave a nasty wobble. Glancing out of his window, Harry \n",
      "saw the smooth, black, glassy surface of the water, a mile below. \n",
      "Ron's knuckles were white on the steering wheel. The car wobbled \n",
      "again. \n",
      "\"Come on,\" Ron muttered. \n",
      "They were over the lake - the castle was right ahead - Ron \n",
      "put his foot down. \n",
      "There was a loud clunk, a splutter, and the engine died com \n",
      "pletely. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Uh-oh,\" said Ron, into the silence. \n",
      " \n",
      "The nose of the car dropped. They were falling, gathering speed, \n",
      "heading straight for the solid castle wall. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Noooooo!\" Ron yelled, swinging the steering wheel around; they \n",
      "missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc, \n",
      "soaring over the dark greenhouses, then the vegetable patch, and then \n",
      "out over the black lawns, losing altitude all the time. \n",
      " \n",
      "Ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand out of \n",
      "his back pocket \n",
      " \n",
      "\"STOP! STOP!\" he yelled, whacking the dashboard and the \n",

      "them \n",
      " \n",
      "\"WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!\" Harry bellowed, lunging for the \n",
      "steering wheel, but too late \n",
      " \n",

      "terror; a golfball-size lump was throbbing on Harry's head where he \n",

      " \n",
      "\"Are you okay?\" Harry said urgently. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"My wand,\" said Ron, in a shaky voice. \"Look at my wand -\" \n",
      " \n",
      "It had snapped, almost in two; the tip was dangling limply, held on by a \n",
      "few splinters. \n",
      " \n",
      "Harry opened his mouth to say he was sure they'd be able to mend it \n",

      " \n",
      "Ron gasped, staring through the windshield, and Harry looked around \n",
      "just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into it. The tree \n",
      "they had hit was attacking them. Its trunk was bent almost double, and \n",
      "its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of the car it could \n",
      "reach. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Aaargh!\" said Ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent into \n",

      "knuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering ram was \n",
      "pounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to be caving \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Run for it!\" Ron shouted, throwing his full weight against his door, but \n",

      "vicious uppercut from another branch. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"We're done for!\" he moaned as the ceiling sagged, but suddenly the \n",
      "floor of the car was vibrating - the engine had restarted. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Reverse!\" Harry yelled, and the car shot backward; the tree was still \n",
      "trying to hit them; they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped \n",
      "itself up, lashing out at them as they sped out of reach. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"That,\" panted Ron, \"was close. Well done, car -\" \n",
      " \n",
      "The car, however, had reached the end of its tether. With two sharp \n",
      "clunks, the doors flew open and Harry felt his seat tip sideways: Next \n",
      "thing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground. Loud thuds told \n",
      "him that the car was ejecting their luggage from the trunk; Hedwig's \n",
      "cage flew through the air and burst open; she rose out of it with an \n",
      "angry screech and sped off toward the castle \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "without a backward look. Then, dented, scratched, and steaming, \n",
      "the car rumbled off into the darkness, its rear lights blazing angrily. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Come back!\" Ron yelled after it, brandishing his broken wand. \n",
      "\"Dad'll kill me!\" \n",
      " \n",
      "But the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its \n",
      "exhaust. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Can you believe our luck?\" said Ron miserably, bending down to \n",
      "pick up Scabbers. \"Of all the trees we could've hit, we had to get \n",
      "one that hits back.\" \n",
      " \n",

      "...... \n",
      " \n",
      "It wasn't at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured. Stiff, cold, \n",
      "and bruised, they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging \n",
      "them up the grassy slope, toward the great oak front doors. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"I think the feast's already started,\" said Ron, dropping his trunk at \n",
      "the foot of the front steps and crossing quietly to look through a \n",

      "outside, sparkled with stars. \n",
      " \n",
      "Through the forest of pointed black Hogwarts hats, Harry saw a long \n",

      "Meanwhile, Professor McGonagall, a bespectacled witch with her hair \n",

      " \n",
      "Every year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and dirty, sorted new \n",
      "students into the four Hogwarts houses (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, \n",
      "Ravenclaw, and Slytherin). Harry well remembered putting it on, \n",
      "exactly one year ago, and waiting, petrified, for its decision as it \n",
      "muttered aloud in his ear. For a few horrible seconds he had feared \n",
      "that the hat was going to put him in Slytherin, the house that had \n",
      "turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any other -but he had \n",
      "ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, Hermione, and the rest of the \n",
      "Weasleys. Last term, Harry and Ron had helped Gryffindor win the \n",
      "House Championship, beating Slytherin for the first time in seven \n",
      "years. \n",
      " \n",
      "A very small, mousy-haired boy had been called forward to place the \n",

      "table, his long silver beard and half-moon glasses shining brightly in the \n",
      "candlelight. Several seats along, Harry saw Gilderoy Lockhart, \n",
      "dressed in robes of aquamarine. And there at the end was Hagrid, \n",
      "huge and hairy, drinking deeply from his goblet. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Hang on. . . \" Harry muttered to Ron. \"There's an empty chair at the \n",

      "Professor Severus Snape was Harry's least favorite teacher. Harry \n",

      " \n",
      "Harry spun around. There, his black robes rippling in a cold breeze, \n",

      "Not daring even to look at each other, Harry and Ron followed Snape \n",
      "up the steps into the vast, echoing entrance hall, which was lit with \n",
      "flaming torches. A delicious smell of food was wafting from the Great \n",

      " \n",
      "\"In!\" he said, opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and \n",

      " \n",
      "\"No, sir, it was the barrier at King's Cross, it - \n",
      " \n",

      "Ron gulped. This wasn't the first time Snape had given Harry the \n",
      "impression of being able to read minds. But a moment later, he un \n",

      " \n",
      "They managed to get to the other side of the common room, still \n",
      "having their backs slapped, and gained the peace of the staircase. \n",
      "They hurried up it, right to the top, and at last reached the door of \n",
      "their old dormitory, which now had a sign on it saying SECOND YEARS. \n",
      "They entered the familiar, circular room, with its five four-posters \n",
      "hung with red velvet and its high, narrow windows. Their trunks had \n",
      "been brought up for them and stood at the ends of their beds. \n",
      " \n",
      "Ron grinned guiltily at Harry. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"I know I shouldn't've enjoyed that or anything, but =' \n",

      "he next day, however, Harry barely grinned once. Things started to go \n",
      "downhill from breakfast in the Great Hall. The four long house tables \n",
      "were laden with tureens of porridge, plates of kippers, mountains of \n",
      "toast, and dishes of eggs and bacon, beneath the enchanted ceiling \n",
      "(today, a dull, cloudy gray). Harry and Ron sat down at the Gryffindor \n",
      "table next to Hermione, who had her copy of Voyages with Vampires \n",
      "propped open against a milk jug. There was a slight stiffness in the \n",
      "way she said \"Morning,\" which told Harry that she was still \n",
      "disapproving of the way they had arrived. Neville Longbottom, on the \n",
      "other hand, greeted them cheerfully. Neville was a round-faced and \n",
      "accident-prone boy with the worst memory of anyone Harry had ever \n",
      "met. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Mail's due any minute - I think Gran's sending a few things I forgot.\" \n",

      " \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "streamed in, circling the hall and dropping letters and packages into the \n",
      "chattering crowd. A big, lumpy package bounced off Neville's head \n",
      "and, a second later, something large and gray fell into Hermione's jug, \n",
      "spraying them all with milk and feathers. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Enrol!\" said Ron, pulling the bedraggled owl out by the feet. Errol \n",

      "\"Oh, no -\" Ron gasped. \n",
      " \n",

      "\"It's not that - it's that.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Ron was pointing at the red envelope. It looked quite ordinary to \n",

      "There was a murmur of interest. They had only ever worked in \n",
      "greenhouse one before - greenhouse three housed far more interesting \n",
      "and dangerous plants. Professor Sprout took a large key from her belt \n",
      "and unlocked the door. Harry caught a whiff of damp earth and \n",
      "fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, umbrella- \n",
      "sized flowers dangling from the ceiling. He was about to follow Ron \n",

      " \n",
      "Judging by Professor Sprout's scowl, she did mind, but Lockhart said, \n",
      "\"That's the ticket,\" and closed the greenhouse door in her face. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Harry,\" said Lockhart, his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight \n",

      "\"Oh, no, Professor, see -\" \n",
      "\"Harry, Harry, Harry,\" said Lockhart, reaching out and grasping \n",

      "start, Harry, it's a start.\" \n",
      "He gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off. Harry stood \n",
      "stunned for a few seconds, then, remembering he was supposed to \n",
      "be in the greenhouse, he opened the door and slid inside. \n",
      "Professor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the cen \n",
      "ter of the greenhouse. About twenty pairs of different-colored ear \n",
      "muffs were lying on the bench. When Harry had taken his place \n",
      "between Ron and Hermione, she said, \"We'll be repotting Man \n",

      "drake?\" \n",
      "To nobody's surprise, Hermione's hand was first into the air. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,\" said Hermione, \n",
      "sounding as usual as though she had swallowed the textbook. \"It is \n",
      "used to return people who have been transfigured or cursed to their \n",
      "original state.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor,\" said Professor Sprout. \"The \n",
      "Mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes. It is also, \n",
      "however, dangerous. Who can tell me why?\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Hermione's hand narrowly missed Harry's glasses as it shot up again. \n",

      "\"The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it,\" she said \n",
      "promptly. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Precisely. Take another ten points,\" said Professor Sprout. \"Now, the \n",
      "Mandrakes we have here are still very young.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "She pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke, and everyone \n",
      "shuffled forward for a better look. A hundred or so tufty little plants, \n",
      "purplish green in color, were growing there in rows. They looked quite \n",
      "unremarkable to Harry, who didn't have the slightest idea what \n",
      "Hermione meant by the \"cry\" of the Mandrake. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Everyone take a pair of earmuffs,\" said Professor Sprout. \n",

      "pink and fluffy. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are completely \n",
      "covered,\" said Professor Sprout. \"When it is safe to remove them, I \n",
      "will give you the thumbs-up. Right - earmuffs on.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut out sound \n",
      "completely. Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own \n",
      "ears, rolled up the sleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants \n",
      "firmly, and pulled hard. \n",
      " \n",
      "Harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear. \n",
      " \n",
      "Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out \n",
      "of the earth. The leaves were growing right out of his head. He had \n",
      "pale green, mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at the top of his \n",
      "lungs. \n",
      " \n",
      "Professor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and \n",
      "plunged the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp compost until \n",
      "only the tufted leaves were visible. Professor Sprout dusted off her \n",
      "hands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed her own earmuffs. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won't kill yet,\" she \n",

      "\"That Lockhart's something, isn't he?\" said Justin happily as they \n",
      "began fiIling their plant pots with dragon dung compost. \"Awfully \n",
      "brave chap. Have you read his books? Id have died of fear if Id been \n",
      "cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but he stayed cool and - \n",

      "\"My name was down for Eton, you know. I can't tell you how glad I \n",

      "After that they didn't have much chance to talk. Their earmuffs were \n",
      "back on and they needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes. Professor \n",
      "Sprout had made it look extremely easy, but it wasn't. The Mandrakes \n",
      "didn't like coming out of the earth, but didn't seem to want to go back \n",
      "into it either. They squirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists, and \n",
      "gnashed their teeth; Harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a \n",
      "particularly fat one into a pot. \n",
      " \n",
      "By the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was sweaty, \n",
      "aching, and covered in earth. Everyone traipsed back to the castle for \n",

      " \n",
      "Professor McGonagall's classes were always hard work, but today \n",
      "was especially difficult. Everything Harry had learned last year \n",

      "supposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all he managed \n",
      " \n",
      "to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the \n",
      "desktop avoiding his wand. \n",
      " \n",
      "Ron was having far worse problems. He had patched up his wand \n",
      "with some borrowed Spellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyond \n",
      "repair. It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every time \n",
      "Ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke \n",
      "that smelled of rotten eggs. Unable to see what he was doing, Ron \n",
      "accidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a \n",
      "new one. Professor McGonagall wasn't pleased. \n",
      " \n",
      "Harry was relieved to hear the lunch bell. His brain felt like a wrung \n",
      "sponge. Everyone fiIed out of the classroom except him and Ron, who \n",

      "watched. Looking up, he saw the very small, mousy-haired boy he'd \n",

      "Pinned to Lockhart's side and burning with humiliation, Harry \n",
      "saw Malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd. \n",

      "They had reached Lockhart's classroom and he let Harry go at \n",

      " \n",

      "\"Well, they're not - they're not very - dangerous, are they?\" Seamus \n",
      "choked. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Don't be so sure!\" said Lockhart, waggling a finger annoyingly at \n",

      "The pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high, with pointed \n",

      "arguing. The moment the cover had been removed, they had started jabbering \n",
      "and rocketing around, rattling the bars and \n",
      "making bizarre faces at the people nearest them. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Right, then,\" Lockhart said loudly. \"Let's see what you make of \n",

      "It was pandemonium. The pixies shot in every direction like rockets. \n",
      "Two of them seized Neville by the ears and lifted him into the air. \n",
      "Several shot straight through the window, showering the back row \n",
      "with broken glass. The rest proceeded to wreck the classroom more \n",
      "effectively than a rampaging rhino. They grabbed ink bottles and \n",
      "sprayed the class with them, shredded books and papers, tore pictures \n",
      "from the walls, up-ended the waste basket, grabbed bags and books \n",
      "and threw them out of the smashed window; within minutes, half the \n",

      " \n",
      "\"Peskipiksi Pesternomi!\" \n",
      " \n",
      "It had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his wand and \n",
      "threw it out of the window, too. Lockhart gulped and dived under his \n",
      "own desk, narrowly avoiding being squashed by Neville, who fell a \n",
      "second later as the chandelier gave way. \n",
      " \n",
      "The bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit. In the relative \n",
      "calm that followed, Lockhart straightened up, caught sight of Harry, \n",
      "Ron, and Hermione, who were almost at the door, and said, \"Well, I'll \n",
      "ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.\" He \n",
      "swept past them and shut the door quickly behind him. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Can you believe him?\" roared Ron as one of the remaining pixies bit \n",
      "him painfully on the ear. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"He just wants to give us some hands-on experience,\" said Hermione, \n",

      " \n",

      " \n",
      "arry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight \n",
      "whenever he saw Gilderoy Lockhart coming down a corridor. Harder \n",
      "to avoid was Colin Creevey, who seemed to have memorized Harry's \n",
      "schedule. Nothing seemed to give Colin a bigger thrill than to say, \"All \n",
      "right, Harry?\" six or seven times a day and hear, \"Hello, Colin,\" back, \n",
      "however exasperated Harry sounded when he said it. \n",

      "Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large, \n",
      "throbbing green boil where it had struck. So with one thing and \n",
      "another, Harry was quite glad to reach the weekend. He, Ron, and \n",
      "Hermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday morning. Harry, \n",

      "Oliver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor \n",
      "Quidditch team. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Whassamatter?\" said Harry groggily. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Quidditch practice!\" said Wood. \"Come on!\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Harry squinted at the window. There was a thin mist hanging across \n",
      "the pink-and-gold sky. Now that he was awake, he couldn't \n",
      "understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds were \n",
      "making. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Oliver,\" Harry croaked. \"It's the crack of dawn.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Wood. He was a tall and burly sixth year and, at the \n",
      "moment, his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm. \"It's part \n",
      "of our new training program. Come on, grab your broom, and let's go,\" \n",
      "said Wood heartily. \"None of the other teams have started training yet; \n",
      "we're going to be first off the mark this year -\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Yawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of bed and tried to \n",

      "\"Good man,\" said Wood. \"Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes. \n",
      " \n",

      "warmth, Harry scribbled a note to Ron explaining where he'd gone and \n",
      "went down the spiral staircase to the common room, his Nimbus Two \n",
      "Thousand on his shoulder. He had just reached the portrait hole when \n",
      "there was a clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dashing down \n",

      "under his nose. \n",
      " \n",
      "A moving, black-and-white Lockhart was tugging hard on an arm \n",
      "Harry recognized as his own. He was pleased to see that his \n",
      "photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be \n",
      "dragged into view. As Harry watched, Lockhart gave up and \n",
      "slumped, panting, against the white edge of the picture. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Will you sign it?\" said Colin eagerly. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"No,\" said Harry flatly, glancing around to check that the room was \n",

      " \n",
      "Colin scrambled through the hole after him. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"It'll be really boring,\" Harry said quickly, but Colin ignored him, his \n",
      "face shining with excitement. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"You were the youngest House player in a hundred years, weren't \n",
      "you, Harry? Weren't you?\" said Colin, trotting alongside him. \"You \n",
      "must be brilliant. I've never flown. Is it easy? Is that your own \n",
      "broom? Is that the best one there is?\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Harry didn't know how to get rid of him. It was like having an \n",
      "extremely talkative shadow. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"I don't really understand Quidditch,\" said Colin breathlessly. \"Is it \n",
      "true there are four balls? And two of them fly around trying to knock \n",
      "people off their brooms?\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry heavily, resigned to explaining the complicated \n",
      "rules of Quidditch. \"They're called Bludgers. There are two Beaters \n",
      "on each team who carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their \n",
      "side. Fred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"And what are the other balls for?\" Colin asked, tripping down a \n",
      "couple of steps because he was gazing open-mouthed at Harry. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Well, the Quafe - that's the biggish red one - is the one that scores \n",
      "goals. Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other \n",
      "and try and get it through the goal posts at the end of the pitch - \n",
      "they're three long poles with hoops on the end.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"And the fourth ball -\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"- is the Golden Snitch,\" said Harry, \"and it's very small, very fast, and \n",
      "difficult to catch. But that's what the Seeker's got to do, because a \n",
      "game of Quidditch doesn't end until the Snitch has been caught. And \n",
      "whichever team's Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra \n",
      "hundred and fifty points.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"And you're the Gryffindor Seeker, aren't you?\" said Colin in awe. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Yes,\" said Harry as they left the castle and started across the dew- \n",
      "drenched grass. \"And there's the Keeper, too. He guards the goal \n",
      "posts. That's it, really.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "But Colin didn't stop questioning Harry all the way down the sloping \n",
      "lawns to the Quidditch field, and Harry only shook him off when he \n",
      "reached the changing rooms; Colin called after him in a piping voice, \n",
      "\"I'll go and get a good seat, Harry!\" and hurried off to the stands. \n",
      " \n",
      "The rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room. \n",
      "Wood was the only person who looked truly awake. Fred and George \n",
      "Weasley were sitting, puffy-eyed and touslehaired, next to fourth year \n",
      "Alicia Spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind \n",
      "her. Her fellow Chasers, Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side \n",
      "by side opposite them. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"There you are, Harry, what kept you?\" said Wood briskly. \"Now, I \n",

      "onto Alicia Spinnet's shoulder and he began to snore. \n",
      " \n",
      "The first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain, but there was \n",

      "They had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up \n",

      "He mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring up into \n",
      "the air. The cool morning air whipped his face, waking him far more \n",
      "effectively than Wood's long talk. It felt wonderful to be back on the \n",

      " \n",
      "None of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a \n",

      "\"Good, aren't they?\" said Malfoy smoothly. \"But perhaps the \n",

      "good-bye to Hagrid and walked back up to the castle, Ron hiccoughing \n",
      "occasionally, but only bringing up two very small slugs. \n",
      " \n",
      "They had barely set foot in the cool entrance hall when a voice rang \n",
      "out, \"There you are, Potter - Weasley.\" Professor McGonagall was \n",
      "walking toward them, looking stern. \"You will both do your detentions \n",
      "this evening.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"What're we doing, Professor?\" said Ron, nervously suppressing a \n",
      "burp. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"You will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with Mr. Filch,\" \n",
      "said Professor McGonagall. \"And no magic, Weasley - elbow grease.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Ron gulped. Argus Filch, the caretaker, was loathed by every student \n",
      "in the school. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"And you, Potter, will be helping Professor Lockhart answer his fan \n",
      "mail,\" said Professor McGonagall. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Oh n - Professor, can't I go and do the trophy room, too?\" said Harry \n",
      "desperately. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Certainly not,\" said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows. \n",
      "\"Professor Lockhart requested you particularly. Eight o'clock sharp, \n",
      "both of you.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Harry and Ron slouched into the Great Hall in states of deepest \n",
      "gloom, Hermione behind them, wearing a well-you-did-break-school- \n",
      "rules  sort of expression. Harry didn't enjoy his shepherd's pie as \n",
      "much as he'd thought. Both he and Ron felt they'd got the worse deal. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Filch'll have me there all night,\" said Ron heavily. \"No magic! There \n",
      "must be about a hundred cups in that room. I'm no good at Muggle \n",
      "cleaning.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"I'd swap anytime,\" said Harry hollowly. \"I've had loads of practice \n",

      "Saturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what seemed like no \n",
      "time, it was five minutes to eight, and Harry was dragging his feet \n",
      "along the second-floor corridor to Lockhart's office. He gritted his \n",
      "teeth and knocked. \n",
      " \n",
      "The door flew open at once. Lockhart beamed down at him. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Ah, here's the scalawag!\" he said. \"Come in, Harry, come in -\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Shining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were \n",
      "countless framed photographs of Lockhart. He had even signed a few \n",

      " \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "\"You can address the envelopes!\" Lockhart told Harry, as though \n",
      "this was a huge treat. \"This first one's to Gladys Gudgeon, bless her - \n",
      "huge fan of mine -\" \n",
      " \n",
      "The minutes snailed by. Harry let Lockhart's voice wash over him, \n",
      "occasionally saying, \"Mmm\" and \"Right\" and \"Yeah.\" Now and then \n",
      "he caught a phrase like, \"Fame's a fickle friend, Harry,\" or \"Celebrity \n",
      "is as celebrity does, remember that.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "The candles burned lower and lower, making the light dance over the \n",
      "many moving faces of Lockhart watching him. Harry moved his \n",
      "aching hand over what felt like the thousandth envelope, writing out \n",
      "Veronica Smethley's address. It must be nearly time to leave, Harry \n",
      "thought miserably, please let it be nearly time... \n",
      " \n",
      "And then he heard something - something quite apart from the \n",
      "spitting of the dying candles and Lockhart's prattle about his fans. \n",
      " \n",
      "It was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a voice of \n",
      "breathtaking, ice-cold venom. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Come ... come to me.... Let me rip you.... Let me tear you .... Let me kill you\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Harry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on Veronica \n",
      "Smethley's street. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"What?\" he said loudly. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"I know!\" said Lockhart. \"Six solid months at the top of the best- \n",
      "seller list! Broke all records!\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"No,\" said Harry frantically. \"That voice!\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Sorry?\" said Lockhart, looking puzzled. \"What voice?\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"That - that voice that said - didn't you hear it?\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Lockhart was looking at Harry in high astonishment. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"What are you talking about, Harry? Perhaps you're getting a litde \n",
      "drowsy? Great Scott - look at the time! We've been here nearly four \n",
      "hours! Id never have believed it - the time's flown, hasn't it?\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Harry didn't answer. He was straining his ears to hear the voice again, \n",
      "but there was no sound now except for Lockhart telling him he mustn't \n",
      "expect a treat like this every time he got detention. Feeling dazed, \n",
      "Harry left. \n",
      " \n",
      "It was so late that the Gryffindor common room was almost empty. \n",
      "Harry went straight up to the dormitory. Ron wasn't back yet. Harry \n",
      "pulled on his pajamas, got into bed, and waited. Half an hour later, Ron \n",
      "arrived, nursing his right arm and bringing a strong smell of polish into \n",
      "the darkened room. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"My muscles have all seized up,\" he groaned, sinking on his bed. \n",
      "\"Fourteen times he made me buff up that Quidditch cup before he was \n",
      "satisfied. And then I had another slug attack all over a Special Award \n",
      "for Services to the School. Took ages to get the slime off... How was \n",
      "it with Lockhart?\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Keeping his voice low so as not to wake Neville, Dean, and Seamus, \n",
      "Harry told Ron exactly what he had heard. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"And Lockhart said he couldn't hear it?\" said Ron. Harry could see \n",
      "him frowning in the moonlight. \"D'you think he was lying? But I don't \n",
      "get it - even someone invisible would've had to open the door.\" \n",
      " \n",

      "canopy above him. \"I don't get it either.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle. \n",
      "Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among \n",
      "the staff and students. Her Pepperup potion worked instantly, though it left \n",
      "the drinker smoking at the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny Weasley, \n",
      "who had been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by Percy. The \n",
      "steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that her whole \n",
      "head was on fire. \n",
      "Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on the castle windows for days on \n",
      "end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy streams, and Hagrid's \n",
      "pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. Oliver Wood's enthusiasm for \n",
      "regular training sessions, however, was not dampened, which was why Harry \n",
      "was to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before \n",
      "Halloween, returning to Gryffindor Tower, drenched to the skin and \n",
      "splattered with mud.. \n",
      " \n",
      "Even aside from the rain and wind it hadn't been a happy practice session. \n",

      "shooting through the air like missiles. \n",
      "As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody \n",
      "who looked just as preoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless Nick, the ghost \n",
      "of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out of a window, muttering \n",
      "under his breath, \". . . don't fulfill their requirements . . . half an inch, if that . \n",
      ". .\" \n",
      "\"Hello, Nick,\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Hello, hello,\" said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking round. He \n",
      "wore a dashing, plumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, \n",
      "which concealed the fact that his neck was almost completely severed. He \n",
      "was pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through him to the dark sky \n",
      "and torrential rain outside. \n",
      "\"You look troubled, young Potter,\" said Nick, folding a transparent letter as \n",
      "he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet. \n",
      "\"So do you,\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Ah,\" Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, \"a matter of no \n",
      "importance. . . . It's not as though I really wanted to join. . . . Thought I'd \n",
      "apply, but apparently I 'don't fulfill requirements' -\" \n",
      "In spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on his face. \n",
      "\"But you would think, wouldn't you,\" he erupted suddenly, pulling the letter \n",
      "back out of his pocket, \"that getting hit forty-five times in the neck with a \n",
      "blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt?\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Oh - yes,\" said Harry, who was obviously supposed to agree. \n",
      "\"I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and clean, \n",
      "and my head had come off properly, I mean, it would have saved me a great \n",
      "deal of pain and ridicule. However -\" Nearly Headless Nick shook his letter \n",
      "open and read furiously: \"'We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have \n",
      "parted company with their bodies. You will appreciate that it would be \n",
      "impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt activities such as \n",
      "Horseback Head-Juggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest regret, \n",
      "therefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements. \n",
      "With very best wishes, Sir Patrick Delaney-Podmore.'\" \n",
      "Fuming, Nearly Headless Nick stuffed the letter away. \n",
      "\"Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Harry! Most people \n",
      "would think that's good and beheaded, but oh, no, it's not enough for Sir \n",
      "Properly Decapitated-Podmore.\" \n",
      "Nearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and then said, in a far \n",
      "calmer tone, \"So - what's bothering you? Anything I can do?\" \n",
      "\"No,\" said Harry. \"Not unless you know where we can get seven free \n",
      "Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for our match against Sly -\" \n",
      "The rest of Harry's sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched mewling \n",
      "from somewhere near his ankles. He looked down and found himself gazing \n",
      "into a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes. It was Mrs. Norris, the skeletal gray cat \n",
      "who was used by the caretaker, Argus Filch, as a sort of deputy in his \n",
      "endless battle against students. \n",
      "\"You'd better get out of here, Harry,\" said Nick quickly. \"Filch isn't in a \n",
      "good mood - he's got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog \n",
      "brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. He's been cleaning all morning, \n",
      "and if he sees you dripping mud all over the place -\" \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Right,\" said Harry, backing away from the accusing stare of Mrs. Norris, \n",
      "but not quickly enough. Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that \n",
      "seemed to connect him with his foul cat, Argus Filch burst suddenly through \n",
      "a tapestry to Harry's right, wheezing and looking wildly about for the rule-\n",
      "breaker. \n",
      "There was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head, and his nose \n",
      "was unusually purple. \n",
      "\"Filth!\" he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes popping alarmingly as he \n",
      "pointed at the muddy puddle that had dripped from Harry's Quidditch robes. \n",
      "\"Mess and muck everywhere! I've had enough of it, I tell you! Follow me, \n",
      "Potter!\" \n",
      "So Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless Nick and followed \n",
      "Filch back downstairs, doubling the number of muddy footprints on the \n",
      "floor. \n",
      "Harry had never been inside Filch's office before; it was a place most \n",
      "students avoided. The room was dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil \n",
      "lamp dangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried fish lingered about \n",
      "the place. Wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls; from their labels, \n",
      "Harry could see that they contained details of every pupil Filch had ever \n",
      "punished. Fred and George Weasley had an entire drawer to themselves. A \n",
      "highly polished collection of chains and manacles hung on the wall behind \n",
      "Filch's desk. It was common knowledge that he was always begging \n",
      "Dumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling. \n",
      "Filch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling around \n",
      "looking for parchment. \n",
      "\"Dung,\" he muttered furiously, \"great sizzling dragon bogies . . . frog brains \n",
      ". . . rat intestines . . . I've had enough of it . . . make an example . . . where's \n",
      "the form . . . yes . . .\" \n",
      " \n",
      "He retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it \n",
      "out in front of him, dipping his long black quill into the ink pot. \n",
      "\"Name . . . Harry Potter. Crime . . .\" \n",
      "\"It was only a bit of mud!\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"It's only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it's an extra hour scrubbing!\" \n",
      "shouted Filch, a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose. \n",
      "\"Crime . . . befouling the castle . . . suggested sentence . . .\" \n",
      "Dabbing at his streaming nose, Filch squinted unpleasantly at Harry who \n",
      "waited with bated breath for his sentence to fall. \n",
      "But as Filch lowered his quill, there was a great BANG! on the ceiling of \n",
      "the office, which made the oil lamp rattle. \n",
      "\"PEEVES!\" Filch roared, flinging down his quill in a transport of rage. \"I'll \n",
      "have you this time, I'll have you!\" \n",
      "And without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran flat-footed from the \n",
      "office, Mrs. Norris streaking alongside him. \n",
      "Peeves was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne menace who lived to \n",
      "cause havoc and distress. Harry didn't much like Peeves, but couldn't help \n",
      "feeling grateful for his timing. Hopefully, whatever Peeves had done (and it \n",
      "sounded as though he'd wrecked something very big this time) would \n",
      "distract Filch from Harry. \n",
      "Thinking that he should probably wait for Filch to come back, Harry sank \n",
      "into a moth-eaten chair next to the desk. There was only one thing on it apart \n",
      "from his half-completed form: a large, glossy, purple envelope with silver \n",
      "lettering on the front. With a quick glance at the door to check that Filch \n",
      "wasn't on his way back, Harry picked up the envelope and read: kwikspell A \n",
      "Correspondence Course in Beginners' Magic. \n",
      " \n",
      "Intrigued, Harry flicked the envelope open and pulled out the sheaf of \n",
      "parchment inside. More curly silver writing on the front page said: Feel out \n",
      "of step in the world of modern magic? Find yourself making excuses not to \n",
      "perform simple spells? Ever been taunted for your woeful wandwork? There \n",
      "is an answer! Kwikspell is an all-new, fail-safe, quick-result, easy-learn \n",
      "course. Hundreds of witches and wizards have benefited from the Kwikspell \n",
      "method! Madam Z. Nettles of Topsham writes: \"I had no memory for \n",
      "incantations and my potions were a family joke! Now, after a Kwikspell \n",
      "course, I am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of \n",
      "my Scintillation Solution!\" Warlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says: \"My wife \n",
      "used to sneer at my feeble charms, but one month into your fabulous \n",
      "Kwikspell course and I succeeded in turning her into a yak! Thank you, \n",
      "Kwikspell!\" \n",
      "Fascinated, Harry thumbed through the rest of the envelope's contents. Why \n",
      "on earth did Filch want a Kwikspell course? Did this mean he wasn't a \n",
      "proper wizard? Harry was just reading \"Lesson One: Holding Your Wand \n",
      "(Some Useful Tips)\" when shuffling footsteps outside told him Filch was \n",
      "coming back. Stuffing the parchment back into the envelope, Harry threw it \n",
      "back onto the desk just as the door opened. \n",
      "Filch was looking triumphant. \n",
      "\"That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!\" he was saying gleefully to \n",
      "Mrs. Norris. \"We'll have Peeves out this time, my sweet -\" \n",
      "His eyes fell on Harry and then darted to the Kwikspell envelope, which, \n",
      "Harry realized too late, was lying two feet away from where it had started. \n",
      "Filch's pasty face went brick red. Harry braced himself for a tidal wave of \n",
      "fury. Filch hobbled across to his desk, snatched up the envelope, and threw it \n",
      "into a drawer. \n",
      "\"Have you - did you read -?\" he sputtered. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"No,\" Harry lied quickly. \n",
      "Filch's knobbly hands were twisting together. \n",
      "\"If I thought you'd read my private - not that it's mine - for a friend - be that \n",
      "as it may - however -\" \n",
      "Harry was staring at him, alarmed; Filch had never looked madder. His eyes \n",
      "were popping, a tic was going in one of his pouchy cheeks, and the tartan \n",
      "scarf didn't help. \n",
      "\"Very well - go - and don't breathe a word - not that - however, if you didn't \n",
      "read - go now, I have to write up Peeves' report - go -\" \n",
      "Amazed at his luck, Harry sped out of the office, up the corridor, and back \n",
      "upstairs. To escape from Filch's office without punishment was probably \n",
      "some kind of school record. \n",
      "\"Harry! Harry! Did it work?\" \n",
      "Nearly Headless Nick came gliding out of a classroom. Behind him, Harry \n",
      "could see the wreckage of a large black-and-gold cabinet that appeared to \n",
      "have been dropped from a great height. \n",
      "\"I persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch's office,\" said Nick eagerly. \n",
      "\"Thought it might distract him -\" \n",
      "\"Was that you?\" said Harry gratefully. \"Yeah, it worked, I didn't even get \n",
      "detention. Thanks, Nick!\" \n",
      "They set off up the corridor together. Nearly Headless Nick, Harry noticed, \n",
      "was still holding Sir Patrick's rejection letter.. \n",
      "\"I wish there was something I could do for you about the Headless Hunt,\" \n",
      "Harry said. \n",
      "Nearly Headless Nick stopped in his tracks and Harry walked right through \n",
      "him. He wished he hadn't; it was like stepping through an icy shower. \n",
      "\"But there is something you could do for me,\" said Nick excitedly. \"Harry - \n",
      "would I be asking too much - but no, you wouldn't want -\" \n",
      "\"What is it?\" said Harry. \n",
      "\"Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth deathday,\" said Nearly \n",
      "Headless Nick, drawing himself up and looking dignified. \n",
      "\"Oh,\" said Harry, not sure whether he should look sorry or happy about this. \n",
      "\"Right.\" \n",
      "\"I'm holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons. Friends will be \n",
      "coming from all over the country. It would be such an honor if you would \n",
      "attend. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger would be most welcome, too, of \n",
      "course - but I daresay you'd rather go to the school feast?\" He watched Harry \n",
      "on tenterhooks. \n",
      "\"No,\" said Harry quickly, \"I'll come -\" \n",
      "\"My dear boy! Harry Potter, at my deathday party! And\" - he hesitated, \n",
      "looking excited - \"do you think you could possibly mention to Sir Patrick \n",
      "how very frightening and impressive you find me?\" \n",
      "\"Of - of course,\" said Harry. \n",
      "Nearly Headless Nick beamed at him. \"A deathday party?\" said Hermione \n",
      "keenly when Harry had changed at last and joined her and Ron in the \n",
      "common room. \"I bet there aren't many living people who can say they've \n",
      "been to one of those - it'll be fascinating!\". \n",
      " \n",
      "\"Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died?\" said Ron, who \n",
      "was halfway through his Potions homework and grumpy. \"Sounds dead \n",
      "depressing to me. . . .\" \n",
      "Rain was still lashing the windows, which were now inky black, but inside \n",
      "all looked bright and cheerful. The firelight glowed over the countless \n",
      "squashy armchairs where people sat reading, talking, doing homework or, in \n",
      "the case of Fred and George Weasley, trying to find out what would happen \n",
      "if you fed a Filibuster firework to a salamander. Fred had \"rescued\" the \n",
      "brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class \n",
      "and it was now smouldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of \n",
      "curious people. \n",
      "Harry was at the point of telling Ron and Hermione about Filch and the \n",
      "Kwikspell course when the salamander suddenly whizzed into the air, \n",
      "emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly round the room. The \n",
      "sight of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at Fred and George, the spectacular \n",
      "display of tangerine stars showering from the salamander's mouth, and its \n",
      "escape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both Filch and the \n",
      "Kwikspell envelope from Harry's mind. By the time Halloween arrived, \n",
      "Harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the deathday party. The rest of \n",
      "the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast; the Great Hall had \n",
      "been decorated with the usual live bats, Hagrid's vast pumpkins had been \n",
      "carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there were \n",
      "rumors that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the \n",
      "entertainment. \n",
      "\"A promise is a promise,\" Hermione reminded Harry bossily. \"You said \n",
      "you'd go to the deathday party.\" \n",
      "So at seven o'clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked straight past the \n",
      "doorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold \n",
      "plates and candles, and directed their steps instead toward the dungeons. \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "The passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick's party had been lined \n",
      "with candles, too, though the effect was far from cheerful: These were long, \n",
      "thin, jet-black tapers, all burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly light \n",
      "even over their own living faces. The temperature dropped with every step \n",
      "they took. As Harry shivered and drew his robes tightly around him, he \n",
      "heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous \n",
      "blackboard. \n",
      "\"Is that supposed to be music?\" Ron whispered. They turned a corner and \n",
      "saw Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet \n",
      "drapes. \n",
      "\"My dear friends,\" he said mournfully. \"Welcome, welcome . . . so pleased \n",
      "you could come. . . .\" \n",
      "He swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside. \n",
      "It was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white, \n",
      "translucent people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor, \n",
      "waltzing to the dreadful, quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played by \n",
      "an orchestra on a raised, black-draped platform. A chandelier overhead \n",
      "blazed midnight-blue with a thousand more black candles. Their breath rose \n",
      "in a mist before them; it was like stepping into a freezer. \n",
      "\"Shall we have a look around?\" Harry suggested, wanting to warm up his \n",
      "feet. \n",
      "\"Careful not to walk through anyone,\" said Ron nervously, and they set off \n",
      "around the edge of the dance floor. They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a \n",
      "ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, \n",
      "who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead. Harry \n",
      "wasn't surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytherin \n",
      "ghost covered in silver bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the \n",
      "other ghosts. \n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" said Hermione, stopping abruptly. \"Turn back, turn back, I don't \n",
      "want to talk to Moaning Myrtle -\" \n",
      "\"Who?\" said Harry as they backtracked quickly. \n",
      "\"She haunts one of the toilets in the girls' bathroom on the first floor,\" said \n",
      "Hermione. \n",
      "\"She haunts a toilet?\" \n",
      "\"Yes. It's been out-of-order all year because she keeps having tantrums and \n",
      "flooding the place. I never went in there anyway if I could avoid it; it's awful \n",
      "trying to have a pee with her wailing at you -\" \n",
      "\"Look, food!\" said Ron. \n",
      "On the other side of the dungeon was a long table, also covered in black \n",
      "velvet. They approached it eagerly but next moment had stopped in their \n",
      "tracks, horrified. The smell was quite disgusting. Large, rotten fish were laid \n",
      "on handsome silver platters; cakes, burned charcoal-black, were heaped on \n",
      "salvers; there was a great maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese covered in furry \n",
      "green mold and, in pride of place, an enormous gray cake in the shape of a \n",
      "tombstone, with tar-like icing forming the words, Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-\n",
      "Porpington \n",
      "died 31st October, 1492 \n",
      "Harry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, crouched \n",
      "low, and walked through it, his mouth held wide so that it passed through \n",
      "one of the stinking salmon. \n",
      "\"Can you taste it if you walk though it?\" Harry asked him. \n",
      "\"Almost,\" said the ghost sadly, and he drifted away. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"I expect they've let it rot to give it a stronger flavor,\" said Hermione \n",
      "knowledgeably, pinching her nose and leaning closer to look at the putrid \n",
      "haggis. \n",
      "\"Can we move? I feel sick,\" said Ron. \n",
      "They had barely turned around, however, when a little man swooped \n",
      "suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in midair before them. \n",
      "\"Hello, Peeves,\" said Harry cautiously. \n",
      "Unlike the ghosts around them, Peeves the Poltergeist was the very reverse \n",
      "of pale and transparent. He was wearing a bright orange party hat, a \n",
      "revolving bow tie, and a broad grin on his wide, wicked face. \n",
      "\"Nibbles?\" he said sweetly, offering them a bowl of peanuts covered in \n",
      "fungus. \n",
      "\"No thanks,\" said Hermione. \n",
      "\"Heard you talking about poor Myrtle,\" said Peeves, his eyes dancing. \n",
      "\"Rude you was about poor Myrtle.\" He took a deep breath and bellowed, \n",
      "\"OY! MYRTLE!\" \n",
      "\"Oh, no, Peeves, don't tell her what I said, she'll be really upset,\" Hermione \n",
      "whispered frantically. \"I didn't mean it, I don't mind her - er, hello, Myrtle.\" \n",
      "The squat ghost of a girl had glided over. She had the glummest face Harry \n",
      "had ever seen, half-hidden behind lank hair and thick, pearly spectacles. \n",
      "\"What?\" she said sulkily. \n",
      "\"How are you, Myrtle?\" said Hermione in a falsely bright voice. \"It's nice to \n",
      "see you out of the toilet.\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Myrtle sniffed. \n",
      "\"Miss Granger was just talking about you -\" said Peeves slyly in Myrtle's \n",
      "ear. \n",
      "\"Just saying - saying - how nice you look tonight,\" said Hermione, glaring \n",
      "at Peeves. \n",
      "Myrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously. \n",
      "\"You're making fun of me,\" she said, silver tears welling rapidly in her \n",
      "small, see-through eyes. \n",
      "\"No - honestly - didn't I just say how nice Myrtle's looking?\" said \n",
      "Hermione, nudging Harry and Ron painfully in the ribs. \n",
      "\"Oh, yeah -\" \n",
      "\"She did -\" \n",
      "\"Don't lie to me,\" Myrtle gasped, tears now flooding down her face, while \n",
      "Peeves chuckled happily over her shoulder. \"D'you think I don't know what \n",
      "people call me behind my back? Fat Myrtle! Ugly Myrtle! Miserable, \n",
      "moaning, moping Myrtle!\" \n",
      "\"You've forgotten pimply,\" Peeves hissed in her ear. \n",
      "Moaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the dungeon. \n",
      "Peeves shot after her, pelting her with moldy peanuts, yelling, \"Pimply! \n",
      "Pimply!\" \n",
      "\"Oh, dear,\" said Hermione sadly. \n",
      "Nearly Headless Nick now drifted toward them through the crowd. \n",
      "\"Enjoying yourselves?\" \n",
      "\"Oh, yes,\" they lied. \n",
      "\"Not a bad turnout,\" said Nearly Headless Nick proudly. \"The Wailing \n",
      "Widow came all the way up from Kent. . . . It's nearly time for my speech, \n",
      "I'd better go and warn the orchestra. . . .\" \n",
      "The orchestra, however, stopped playing at that very moment. They, and \n",
      "everyone else in the dungeon, fell silent, looking around in excitement, as a \n",
      "hunting horn sounded. \n",
      "\"Oh, here we go,\" said Nearly Headless Nick bitterly. \n",
      "Through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses, each ridden by a \n",
      "headless horseman. The assembly clapped wildly; Harry started to clap, too, \n",
      "but stopped quickly at the sight of Nick's face. \n",
      "The horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and halted, rearing \n",
      "and plunging. At the front of the pack was a large ghost who held his \n",
      "bearded head under his arm, from which position he was blowing the horn. \n",
      "The ghost leapt down, lifted his head high in the air so he could see over the \n",
      "crowd (everyone laughed), and strode over to Nearly Headless Nick, \n",
      "squashing his head back onto his neck. \n",
      "\"Nick!\" he roared. \"How are you? Head still hanging in there?\" \n",
      "He gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless Nick on the shoulder. \n",
      "\"Welcome, Patrick,\" said Nick stiffly. \n",
      "\"Live 'uns!\" said Sir Patrick, spotting Harry, Ron, and Hermione and giving \n",
      "a huge, fake jump of astonishment, so that his head fell off again (the crowd \n",
      "howled with laughter). \n",
      "\"Very amusing,\" said Nearly Headless Nick darkly. \n",
      "\"Don't mind Nick!\" shouted Sir Patrick's head from the floor. \"Still upset we \n",
      "won't let him join the Hunt! But I mean to say - look at the fellow -\" \n",
      "\"I think,\" said Harry hurriedly, at a meaningful look from Nick, \"Nick's very \n",
      "- frightening and - er -\" \n",
      "\"Ha!\" yelled Sir Patrick's head. \"Bet he asked you to say that!\" \n",
      "\"If I could have everyone's attention, it's time for my speech!\" said Nearly \n",
      "Headless Nick loudly, striding toward the podium and climbing into an icy \n",
      "blue spotlight. \n",
      "\"My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great sorrow . . .\" \n",
      "But nobody heard much more. Sir Patrick and the rest of the Headless Hunt \n",
      "had just started a game of Head Hockey and the crowd were turning to \n",
      "watch. Nearly Headless Nick tried vainly to recapture his audience, but gave \n",
      "up as Sir Patrick's head went sailing past him to loud cheers. \n",
      "Harry was very cold by now, not to mention hungry. \n",
      "\"I can't stand much more of this,\" Ron muttered, his teeth chattering, as the \n",
      "orchestra ground back into action and the ghosts swept back onto the dance \n",
      "floor. \n",
      "\"Let's go,\" Harry agreed. \n",
      "They backed toward the door, nodding and beaming at anyone who looked \n",
      "at them, and a minute later were hurrying back up the passageway full of \n",
      "black candles. \n",
      "\"Pudding might not be finished yet,\" said Ron hopefully, leading the way \n",
      "toward the steps to the entrance hall. \n",
      "And then Harry heard it. \n",
      "\". . . rip . . . tear . . . kill . . .\" \n",
      "It was the same voice, the same cold, murderous voice he had heard in \n",
      "Lockhart's office. \n",
      "He stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, listening with all his \n",
      "might, looking around, squinting up and down the dimly lit passageway. \n",
      "\"Harry, what're you -?\" \n",
      "\"It's that voice again - shut up a minute -\" \n",
      "\". . . soo hungry . . . for so long . . .\" \n",
      "\"Listen!\" said Harry urgently, and Ron and Hermione froze, watching him. \n",
      "\". . . kill . . . time to kill . . .\" \n",
      "The voice was growing fainter. Harry was sure it was moving away - \n",
      "moving upward. A mixture of fear and excitement gripped him as he stared \n",
      "at the dark ceiling; how could it be moving upward? Was it a phantom, to \n",
      "whom stone ceilings didn't matter? \n",
      "\"This way,\" he shouted, and he began to run, up the stairs, into the entrance \n",
      "hall. It was no good hoping to hear anything here, the babble of talk from the \n",
      "Halloween feast was echoing out of the Great Hall. Harry sprinted up the \n",
      "marble staircase to the first floor, Ron and Hermione clattering behind him. \n",
      "\"Harry, what're we -\" \n",
      "\"SHH!\" \n",
      "Harry strained his ears. Distantly, from the floor above, and growing fainter \n",
      "still, he heard the voice: \". . . I smell blood. . . . I SMELL BLOOD!\" \n",
      "His stomach lurched - \n",
      "\"It's going to kill someone!\" he shouted, and ignoring Ron's and Hermione's \n",
      "bewildered faces, he ran up the next flight of steps three at a time, trying to \n",
      "listen over his own pounding footsteps - \n",
      "Harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor, Ron and Hermione \n",
      "panting behind him, not stopping until they turned a corner into the last, \n",
      "deserted passage. \n",
      "\"Harry, what was that all about?\" said Ron, wiping sweat off his face. \"I \n",
      "couldn't hear anything. . . .\" \n",
      "But Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the corridor. \n",
      "\"Look!\" \n",
      "Something was shining on the wall ahead. They approached slowly, \n",
      "squinting through the darkness. Foot-high words had been daubed on the \n",
      "wall between two windows, shimmering in the light cast by the flaming \n",
      "torches. the chamber of secrets has been opened. enemies of the heir, \n",
      "beware. \n",
      "\"What's that thing - hanging underneath?\" said Ron, a slight quiver in his \n",
      "voice. \n",
      "As they edged nearer, Harry almost slipped - there was a large puddle of \n",
      "water on the floor; Ron and Hermione grabbed him, and they inched toward \n",
      "the message, eyes fixed on a dark shadow beneath it. All three of them \n",
      "realized what it was at once, and leapt backward with a splash..Mrs. Norris,  \n",
      "the caretaker's cat, was hanging by her tail from the torch \n",
      "bracket. She was stiff as a board, her eyes wide and staring. \n",
      "For a few seconds, they didn't move. Then Ron said, \"Let's get out of here.\" \n",
      "\"Shouldn't we try and help -\" Harry began awkwardly. \n",
      "\"Trust me,\" said Ron. \"We don't want to be found here.\" \n",
      "But it was too late. A rumble, as though of distant thunder, told them that \n",
      "the feast had just ended. From either end of the corridor where they stood \n",
      "came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happy \n",
      "talk of well-fed people; next moment, students were crashing into the \n",
      "passage from both ends. \n",
      "The chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in front spotted \n",
      "the hanging cat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood alone, in the middle of the \n",
      "corridor, as silence fell among the mass of students pressing forward to see \n",
      "the grisly sight. \n",
      "Then someone shouted through the quiet. \n",
      "\"Enemies of the Heir, beware! You'll be next, Mudbloods!\" \n",
      "It was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, his cold eyes \n",
      "alive, his usually bloodless face flushed, as he grinned at the sight of the \n",
      "hanging, immobile cat. \n",
